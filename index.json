First, we used a seven-data set capture-recapture analysis under log-linear model parameterization, controlling for the source dependence and effects of age, sex, and county through stratification. Second, we applied a benchmark-multiplier method in a Bayesian framework by linking healthcare claims data to death certificate data assuming an extrapolation of death rates from observed untreated OUD to unobserved OUD. The estimates for OUD among MA residents were compared using the results from each approach and were 4.62% (95% CI: 4.59%, 4.64%) in the capture-recapture and 4.29% (95% CrI: 3.49%, 5.32%) in the Bayesian model.

Accurate estimates of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) are critical to plan for the scope of interventions required to reduce overdose and opioid misuse. Commonly used household surveys are known to underestimate OUD at the state-level and do not provide county-level estimates.\nMethods We performed a multi-sample capture-recapture analysis to estimate OUD prevalence in Kentucky in 2018 and 2019. We utilized four statewide datasets that were linked at the individual level: 1) Registry of Vital Statistics, 2) Emergency Medical Services (EMS), 3) Kentucky’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), and 4) Kentucky Medicaid. We included persons aged 18–64 years who resided in Kentucky between 2018 and 2019. We identified individuals with administrative data consistent with OUD in each of the datasets, including a fatal opioid-involved overdose (Vital Statistics), EMS runs for suspected opioid overdose, receipt of buprenorphine for OUD treatment (PDMP), or Medicaid claims for OUD. Observed and estimated counts of OUD cases and prevalence of OUD among the adult population in Kentucky.\nResults The estimated statewide OUD prevalence was 5.5 % and 5.9 % for 2018 and 2019, respectively, ranging from 1.3 % to 17.7 % across Kentucky counties. As expected, counties with the highest OUD rates were Appalachian counties (eastern area) of the state.\nConclusions Our analysis reveals a substantially larger proportion of KY residents have OUD than previously estimated.

While overdoses continue to increase, accurate estimates of the prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) are needed to understand the size of the population at risk for overdose. Though overdoses are more common in males, the sex breakdown in OUD prevalence is unknown.\nObjectives: To estimate the prevalence of OUD in Massachusetts from 2014 to 2018, stratified by sex.\nMethods: We performed a capture-recapture analysis in Massachusetts from 2014-2018 among persons aged 18-64 years. We stratified our analysis by sex and used seven statewide datasets that were individually linked within the state’s Public Health Data Warehouse. We developed log linear models to estimate people previously unknown to have OUD. We estimated counts and prevalence of OUD among the adult population by sex.\nResults: The estimated OUD prevalence increased from 4.74% (95% CI = 4.73%, 4.76%) in 2014 to 6.68% (95% CI = 6.66%, 6.70%) in 2018. Over that time, the proportion of the total prevalence attributable to females was 37% in 2014, 46% in 2015, 38% in 2016, 35% in 2017, and 44% in 2018. The proportion of estimated OUD cases known by the system remained stable (between 33%-43%), as well as the ratio of the proportion of females who were known to the unknown.\nConclusion: Overall prevalence estimates are significantly higher than those from NSDUH. Females account for nearly half of OUD prevalence in Massachusetts with no increase in the number who were previously unknown to the healthcare system.\n","date":1667739600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667739600,"objectID":"94045db1bbc82d949fc940aad1cbfec1","permalink":"https://jianing-jenny-wang.github.io/presentations/2022-apha/","publishdate":"2022-11-06T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentations/2022-apha/","section":"presentations","summary":"Presentation at 2022 APHA","tags":null,"title":"Race and Gender Differences in Opioid Use Disorder in Massachusetts from 2014 through 2019, a Capture-Recapture Analysis","type":"presentations"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We propose a two-stage Bayesian hierarchical model with spatial smoothing using a capture-recapture data structure to estimate community-specific opioid use disorder (OUD) prevalence.

Because public insurers often set precedents for private insurer coverage and clinician practice patterns, this study sought to analyze whether spillover occurs from state Medicaid HCV treatment restrictions to HCV screening and treatment rates in commercially insured individuals.\nMethods Investigators analyzed 2014‒2017 commercial claims data across 48 U.S. states (721,961,965 person-months) and used an interrupted times series design to compare hepatitis C virus screening and treatment rates before and after state Medicaid HCV treatment policy changes, adjusting for state-level random effects, Medicaid expansion status, and state drug overdose incidence rates, in states that relaxed Medicaid policy over the study period. Analysis occurred during 2019‒2021.\nResults Hepatitis C virus screening rates among commercially insured individuals increased after the corresponding state Medicaid program relaxed HCV treatment policy. Among states that changed Medicaid policy, those that reduced fibrosis or both fibrosis and abstinence restrictions experienced increased HCV screening rates by the study end compared with states that changed only abstinence restrictions (rate ratio=1.29; 95% CI=1.15, 1.44; and rate ratio=1.32; 95% CI=1.17, 1.50, respectively). Similar patterns did not occur in HCV treatment rates, which declined after 2015 across groups.\nConclusions These data show that HCV screening rates increased among commercially insured individuals after the removal of Medicaid HCV treatment restrictions in the same state.

The capture-recapture (CRC) method and the multiplier-benchmark method (MBM) are two commonly used approaches using data that partially capture the target population and overlap in a known way. Due to similarities in required data structures, the approaches are often used interchangeably without critical appraisal of the underlying assumptions, especially in the two-sample case. We describe the sampling mechanisms and assumptions underlying both approaches to highlight similarities and differences. We emphasize that the CRC method uses data sources as random samples and describes two-way inclusion patterns. In contrast, in MBM, one source collects a sub-population that is seen as fixed, and the one-way inclusion pattern is modeled. We also discuss the implications of these differences through simulation and real data to guide the choice of method in practice. Careful study of data structure, relationship, and possible generation process are crucial to assess the appropriateness of using these methods.\nKeywords: Population size estimation, capture-recapture, benchmark-multiplier\n","date":1659877200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659877200,"objectID":"60f1825d25b4aa4ecc4387791af4f84d","permalink":"https://jianing-jenny-wang.github.io/presentations/2022-jsm/","publishdate":"2022-08-07T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentations/2022-jsm/","section":"presentations","summary":"Presentation at 2022 JSM","tags":null,"title":"On the estimation of population size – A comparison of capture-recapture and multiplier-benchmark methods","type":"presentations"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We used multiple individually linked administrative health data to compare the results of stratified capture-recapture analysis and Bayesian multiplier benchmark analysis to estimate OUD prevalence in the Massachusetts population.\n","date":1656547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656547200,"objectID":"f3d11a79309637581586402f631afd66","permalink":"https://jianing-jenny-wang.github.io/research/hidden-population/","publishdate":"2022-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/hidden-population/","section":"research","summary":"We used multiple individually linked administrative health data to compare the results of stratified capture-recapture analysis and Bayesian multiplier benchmark analysis to estimate OUD prevalence in the Massachusetts population.","tags":["Application"],"title":"Population size estimation methods using incomplete disease surveillance data","type":"research"},{"authors":["Alexandra Savinkina","Rajapaksha WMA Madushani","Golnaz Eftekhari Yazdi","Jianing Wang","Joshua A Barocas","Jake R Morgan","Sabrina A Assoumou","Alexander Y Walley","Benjamin P Linas","Sean M Murphy"],"categories":null,"content":" abstract Background and Aims Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are shown to reduce opioid use and the risk of overdose. People with opioid use disorder (OUD) who exit inpatient medically managed withdrawal programs (detox) without initiating MOUD and linking to outpatient care have high rates of overdose. While detox encounters provide a theoretical opportunity for MOUD initiation, this is not ubiquitous in the United States. We used simulation modeling to estimate the population-level health effects and cost-effectiveness of a policy encouraging MOUD initiation during inpatient detox encounters.\nDesign, Setting and Participants We employed a dynamic population state-transition model to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using detox programs as venues for initiating MOUD in Massachusetts, United States.

With moderate linkage, fatal overdoses would be reduced by 2.3% (95% CI= 1.2–3.1) with an ICER of $78 500 per QALY gained, compared with standard of care.

A variety of factors contribute to this elevated risk though our understanding of these factors is deficient. Research to identify risk and protective factors for overdose is often conducted using administrative data or researcher-derived surveys and without explicit input from people with lived experience. We aimed to understand the scope of U.S. research on factors associated with opioid overdose among previously incarcerated people. We did this by conducting a narrative review of the literature and convening expert panels of people with lived experience. We then categorized these factors using a social determinants of health framework to help contextualize our findings.\nMethods We first conducted a narrative review of the published literature. A search was performed using PubMed and APA PsycInfo. We then convened two expert panels consisting of people with lived experience and people who work with people who were previously incarcerated. Experts were asked to evaluate the literature derived factors for completeness and add factors that were not identified. Finally, we categorized factors as either intermediary or structural according to the World Health Organization’s Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Framework.\nResults We identified 13 papers that met our inclusion criteria for the narrative review. Within these 13 papers, we identified 22 relevant factors for their role in the relationship between overdose and people with a history of incarceration, 16 were risk factors and six were protective factors. Five of these were structural factors (three risk and two protective) and 17 were intermediary factors (13 risk and four protective). The expert panels identified 21 additional factors, 10 of which were structural (six risk and four protective) and 11 of which were intermediary (eight risk and three protective).\nConclusion This narrative review along with expert panels demonstrates a gap in the published literature regarding factors associated with overdose among people who were previously incarcerated. Additionally, this review highlights a substantial gap with regard to the types of factors that are typically identified. Incorporating voices of people with lived experience is crucial to our understanding of overdose in this at-risk population.\n","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"d89abfa65aeb26cf1ea0d56572f0ba80","permalink":"https://jianing-jenny-wang.github.io/publication/flamross-2022-ijdp/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/flamross-2022-ijdp/","section":"publication","summary":"abstract Background People with a history of incarceration are at high risk for opioid overdose.

Indirect estimation methods may provide more accurate estimates than surveys. Using 2015 data from the Massachusetts Public Health Data Warehouse (PHD), we performed a comparative analysis of two indirect estimation methods to estimate OUD prevalence among the Massachusetts Medicaid population. We first used a seven data set capture/re-capture (CRC), stratified by age, sex, and county to account for the individual heterogeneity. We used log-linear models to estimate the unknown OUD population and estimated confidence intervals (CI) using distributional bootstrapping. We applied a Bayesian prevalence estimation model by linking Medicaid claims data to opioid-related death data with the assistance of OUD treatment data. In doing so, we were able to calculate opioid-related death rates for the known OUD population while off-treatment. We assumed that unknown persons with OUD had overdose death rates equal to the known population while off-treatment, following a Poisson distribution. We added random effects to counties and generated 95% credible intervals (CrI) from posteriors. The prevalence of OUD was 9.43% (95% CrI: 7.49%, 12.00%) in the Bayesian model and 8.60% (95% CI: 8.57%, 8.65%) in the CRC. Estimates in small counties were more different than large counties. Estimates were more similar among middle-aged groups than older or younger age groups. From this analysis, we found that the CRC, with more data available, provided a similar state-level estimates to the Bayesian method; but the group-specific estimates of unobserved OUD differed.\n","date":1635253200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635253200,"objectID":"ea2598dcef909f55742f5ae481413bd5","permalink":"https://jianing-jenny-wang.github.io/presentations/2021-apha/","publishdate":"2021-10-26T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentations/2021-apha/","section":"presentations","summary":"Presentation at 2021 APHA","tags":null,"title":"Massachusetts prevalence of opioid use disorder estimation revisited: Comparing a bayesian approach to standard capture-recapture methods","type":"presentations"},{"authors":["Sabrina A Assoumou","Samantha M Paniagua","Priscilla Gonzalez","Jianing Wang","Curt G Beckwith","Laura F White","Jessica L Taylor","Kristen Coogan","Jeffrey H Samet","Benjamin P Linas"],"categories":null,"content":" abstract Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and buprenorphine decrease HIV acquisition.

In response, the US Department of Health and Human Services has defined a goal to reduce overdose mortality by 40% by 2022.\nObjective To identify specific combinations of 3 interventions (initiating more people to medications for opioid use disorder [MOUD], increasing 6-month retention with MOUD, and increasing naloxone distribution) associated with at least a 40% reduction in opioid overdose in simulated populations.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants This decision analytical model used a dynamic population-level state-transition model to project outcomes over a 2-year horizon. Each intervention scenario was compared with the counterfactual of no intervention in simulated urban and rural communities in Massachusetts. Simulation modeling was used to determine the associations of community-level interventions with opioid overdose rates. The 3 examined interventions were initiation of more people to MOUD, increasing individuals’ retention with MOUD, and increasing distribution of naloxone. Data were analyzed from July to November 2020.\nMain Outcomes and Measures Reduction in overdose mortality, medication treatment capacity needs, and naloxone needs.\nResults No single intervention was associated with a 40% reduction in overdose mortality in the simulated communities. Reaching this goal required use of MOUD and naloxone. Achieving a 40% reduction required that 10% to 15% of the estimated OUD population not already receiving MOUD initiate MOUD every month, with 45% to 60%% retention for at least 6 months, and increased naloxone distribution. In all feasible settings and scenarios, attaining a 40% reduction in overdose mortality required that in every month, at least 10% of the population with OUD who were not currently receiving treatment initiate an MOUD.\nConclusions and Relevance In this modeling study, only communities with increased capacity for treating with MOUD and increased MOUD retention experienced a 40% decrease in overdose mortality.

We used individual-level data from 57 FQHCs to model 9 strategies, including permutations of HCV antibody testing modality, person initiating testing, and testing approach. Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), hepatitis C cases identified, treated and cured; and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.\nResults Compared with current practice (risk-based with laboratory-based testing), routine rapid point-of-care testing initiated and performed by a counselor identified 68% more cases after (nonreflex) RNA testing in the first month of the intervention and led to a 17% reduction in cirrhosis cases and a 22% reduction in liver deaths among those with cirrhosis over a lifetime.

Of the 200 randomized, 98 received RT and 102 LBT. Among all participants, 0.5% were positive for HIV and 48% for HCV; 96% received test results in the RT arm and 42% in the LBT arm (odds ratio, 28.72; 95% confidence interval, 10.27–80.31). Real-world case notification was 95% and 93% for HIV and HCV RT, respectively, compared to 42% for HIV and HCV LBT.\nConclusions RT has higher real-world case notification than LBT at drug detoxification centers.\nClinical trials registration: NCT02869776.\nKeywords: HIV, hepatitis C, testing, linkage to care, injection drug use, drug treatment\n","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601510400,"objectID":"91862859c29432492fa69c95aa2d0f68","permalink":"https://jianing-jenny-wang.github.io/publication/assoumou-2020-jid/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/assoumou-2020-jid/","section":"publication","summary":"abstract Background A health department survey revealed nearly half employ laboratory-based HIV and HCV testing (LBT) over rapid testing (RT) in nonhospital settings such as drug detoxification centers.

We measured the person-years accumulated during each transition period to calculate rates of opioid-related overdose, and investigated how overdose differed in select populations.\nResults: Sixty-one percent of inpatient detoxification admissions resulted in a subsequent inpatient detoxification admission without progressing to further inpatient care. Overall, there were 287 fatal and 7,337 non-fatal overdoses. Persons exiting treatment after detoxification had the greatest risk of overdose (17.3 per 100 person-years) compared to those who exited after subsequent inpatient care (ranging from 5.9 to 6.6 overdoses per 100 person-years). Non-Hispanic whites were most at risk for opioid related overdose with 16 overdoses per 100 person-years and non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest risk with 5 overdoses per 100 person-years.\nConclusions: The majority of inpatient detoxification admissions do not progress to further inpatient care.

Generalized linear models were used to predict the network statistics of the original network from the network statistics of the sample network and observable sample design features. We found that RDS may introduce significant biases in the estimation of density/mean degree and transitivity, and may exaggerate homophily when preferential recruitment occurs.

We simulated a US prison cohort at entry using published data and Washington State DOC individual-level data. We considered permutations of testing (risk factor based, routine at entry or at release, no testing), treatment (if liver fibrosis stage ≥F3, for all HCV infected or no treatment), and linkage to care (at release or no linkage).

A challenge in metamodeling for policy analysis is that there are often multiple correlated outputs of interest: for example, costs and effects of different policy choices. We develop a framework for metamodeling that accommodates multivariate outcomes, and we compare alternatives for the choice of the base learning algorithm.\nMethods: To generate metamodels for multivariate outcomes, we combined two algorithm adaptation methods – multi-target stacking (MTS) and regression chain with maximum correlation chain (RCCC) – together with different base learners including linear regression (LR), elastic net (EN) with second-order terms, Gaussian process regression (GPR), random forests (RFs), and neural networks (NNs). We optimized the integrated models using variable selection and hyperparameter tuning. We compared approaches in terms of model accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. To illustrate the framework, we used inputs and outputs from an individual-based decision analytic simulation model of testing and treatment strategies for chronic hepatitis C virus in correctional settings. The training data set included 2,000 simulations, each summarized by 37 input variables and 60 output variables (5 economic and health outcomes for 6 alternative strategies measured over 2 time horizons).\nResults: The output variables from the simulation model were heavily correlated (average rho=0.58). Without multioutput algorithm adaptation methods, in-sample fit (measured by R2) ranged from 0.881 for LR to 0.987 for GPR. Inclusion of multioutput algorithm adaptation methods increased R2by 0.004 on average across all base leaners, and variable selection and hyperparameter tuning added 0.009. In terms of model efficiency, simpler models such as LR, EN, and RF required minimal training and prediction time. GPR had short prediction time, but the training time was heavily affected by the size of the training dataset. NN had the longest training and prediction time. For model interpretability, LR and EN have clear advantages, but we also consider methods for improving interpretability of other models.\nConclusions: This study provides a framework for metamodeling in policy analyses with multivariate outcomes of interest. While the advantages and disadvantages of specific learning algorithms may vary across different modeling applications, we expect that the general framework presented here will have broad applicability to decision analytic models in health and medicine.\n","date":1571529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571529600,"objectID":"62a62d696c502480281fc959bc2657e6","permalink":"https://jianing-jenny-wang.github.io/publication/zhong-2019-conf/","publishdate":"2019-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhong-2019-conf/","section":"publication","summary":"abstract Purpose: A metamodel is a simplified approximation of the relationships between inputs and outputs in a simulation model.

Our aims were to determine the target limit of detection (LOD) necessary to diagnose the majority of persons with HCV eligible for treatment, and identify characteristics associated with low-level viraemia (LLV) (defined as the lowest 3% of the distribution of HCV RNA) to understand those at risk of being mis-diagnosed.\nMETHODS: We established a multi-country cross-sectional dataset of first available quantitative HCV RNA linked to demographic and clinical data. We excluded individuals on HCV treatment. We analyzed the distribution of HCV RNA and determined critical thresholds for detection of HCV viraemia. We then performed logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with LLV, and derived relative sensitivities for significant covariates.\nRESULTS: The dataset included 66,640 individuals with HCV viraemia from Georgia (44.4%), Canada (40.9%), India (8.1%), Cambodia (2.6%), Egypt (1.6%), Pakistan (1.3%), Cameroon (0.4%), Indonesia (0.2%), Thailand (0.2%), Vietnam (0.1%), Malaysia (0.05%), and Mozambique (0.02%). The 97% LOD was 1,318 IU/mL (95% CI 1298.4, 1322.3). Factors associated with LLV were younger age 18–30 vs. 51–64 years (OR 2.56 95% CI 2.19, 2.99), female vs. male sex (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.18, 1.49), and advanced fibrosis stage F4 vs. F0–1 (OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.21, 1.69).

Particular attention was focused on the role of stimulants in opioid overdose deaths.\nMethods: We analyzed all opioid-related overdose deaths from 2014–2015 in an individually-linked population database in Massachusetts. We used linked postmortem toxicology data to identify drugs present at the time of death. We constructed a multinomial logistic regression model to identify factors associated with three mutually exclusive overdose death groups based on toxicological results: opioid-related deaths with (1) opioids only present, (2) opioids and other substances not including stimulants, and (3) opioids and stimulants with or without other substances.\nResults: Between 2014 and 2015, there were 2,244 opioid-related overdose deaths in Massachusetts that had accompanying toxicology results. Toxicology reports indicated that 17% had opioids only, 36% had opioids plus stimulants, and 46% had opioids plus another non-stimulant substance. Persons older than 24 years, non-rural residents, those with comorbid mental illness, non-Hispanic black residents, and persons with recent homelessness were more likely than their counterparts to die with opioids and stimulants than opioids alone.\nConclusions: Polysubstance opioid overdose is increasingly common in the US. Addressing modifiable social determinants of health including barriers to mental health services and homelessness, is important to reduce polysubstance use and overdose deaths.\nKeywords: opioid-related overdose, polysubstance use, stimulants, cocaine, amphetamines\n","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"1060427793a848608d799dcd66527e8e","permalink":"https://jianing-jenny-wang.github.io/publication/barocas-2019-daad/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/barocas-2019-daad/","section":"publication","summary":"abstract Background and Aims: While prescribed and illicit opioid use are primary drivers of the national surges in overdose deaths, opioid overdose deaths in which stimulants are also present are increasing in the U.","tags":null,"title":"Sociodemographic factors and social determinants associated with toxicology confirmed polysubstance opioid-related deaths","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction Current population estimates of opioid use disorder (OUD) can be derived from a capture-recapture study.

The aim of this study was to determine the most effective hepatitis C virus testing strategy in one U.S. state prison and describe the population with reactive testing.\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was performed using individuals entering the Washington State prison system, which routinely offers hepatitis C virus testing, to compare routine opt-out to current recommendations for risk-based and one-time testing for individuals born between 1945 and 1965. Additionally, liver fibrosis stage was characterized using aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index and Fibrosis-4. Analyses were conducted in 2017.\nResults: Between 2012 and 2016, a total of 24,567 (83%) individuals were tested for the hepatitis C virus antibody and 4,921 (20%) were reactive (test was positive). There were 2,403 (49%) that had hepatitis C virus RNA testing with 1,727 (72%) showing chronic infection. Reactive antibody was more prevalent in individuals born between 1945 and 1965 compared with other years (44% vs 17%); however, most cases (72%) were outside of this cohort. Up to 35% of positive reactive tests would be missed with testing targeted by birth cohort and risk behavior. Of chronically infected individuals, 23% had at least moderate liver fibrosis.\nConclusions: Targeted testing in the Washington State prison system missed a substantial proportion of hepatitis C virus cases; of those with reactive testing, a sizeable proportion of people had at least moderate liver disease placing them at risk for complications.

This strategy targets HCV testing to a prevalent population at high risk for HCV morbidity and mortality, but does not include younger populations with high incidence. To address this gap and improve access to HCV testing, age-based strategies should be considered.\nMethods We used a simulation of HCV to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HCV testing strategies: 1) standard of care (SOC) – recommendation for one-time testing for all persons born 1945–1965, 2) recommendation for one-time testing for adults ≥40 years (≥40 strategy), 3) ≥30 years (≥30 strategy), and 4) ≥18 years (≥18 strategy). All strategies assumed targeted testing of high-risk persons. Inputs were derived from national databases, observational cohorts and clinical trials. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and cost-effectiveness.\nResults Expanded age-based testing strategies increased US population lifetime case identification and cure rates. Greatest increases were observed in the ≥18 strategy. Compared to the SOC, this strategy resulted in an estimated 256,000 additional infected persons identified and 280,000 additional cures at the lowest cost per QALY gained (ICER = $28,000/QALY).\nConclusions In addition to risk-based testing, one-time HCV testing of persons 18 and older appears to be cost-effective, leads to improved clinical outcomes and identifies more persons with HCV than the current birth cohort recommendations.
